# BT2 Horizon Prototype

This is a small React + Vite prototype for the "BT2 Horizon" one-page experience. It uses Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion for styling and interactions.

Getting started (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
cd 'C:/Users/grush/Downloads/Master/Devop/Adrian/DT2'
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- The prototype includes placeholder assets in `/assets` (hero video, poster, Adrian portrait). Replace them with real files.
- If Tailwind directives cause editor lint warnings, they are expected in plain CSS files but will compile correctly when run with PostCSS + Tailwind.
